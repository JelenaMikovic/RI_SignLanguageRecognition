# Sign language recognition
Technologies: Python, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, MediaPipe library

•	Continuously developing an advanced machine learning solution to recognize sign language gestures, contributing to accessibility and communication for the hearing-impaired community.

•	Current achievement is a trained model on a small dataset containing videos and performed keypoint extraction for 3 WASL words. Achieved a recognition accuracy of 100%.

•	Future goal is to train the model on a comprehensive dataset for around 2000 WASL words.
